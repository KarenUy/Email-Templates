Dear Andrew,

To start the culmination of our Cybersecurity course, we need to group you together with another 2 members to build a team for you to prepare for the Demo Day. We aim to make you comfortable working on with your groupmates to showcase what you have learned and deliver a best project. With that, we sent out a group survey to match you with the people that will likely expose your skills and capabilities. Kindly help to accomplish the survey form in the **soonest possible time** so that we can determine which team you are best fit.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you.


All the Best,
